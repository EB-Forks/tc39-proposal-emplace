# `Map.prototype.upsert`

ECMAScript proposal and reference implementation for `Map.prototype.upsert`.

**Author:** Brad Farias (GoDaddy)

**Champion:** Erica Pramer (GoDaddy)

**Stage:** 1

## Motivation

Adding and updating values of a Map are tasks that developers often perform 
in conjunction. There are currently no `Map` prototype methods for either of
those two things, let alone a method that does both. The workarounds involve
multiple lookups and developer inconvenience.

## Solution: `upsert`

We propose the addition of a method that will add a value to a map if the map
does not already have something at `key`, and will also update an existing 
value at `key`. 
Itâ€™s worthwhile having this API for the average case to cut down on lookups.
It is also worthwhile for developer convenience and expression of intent.

## Examples & Proposed API

The following examples would all be optimized and made simpler by `upsert`.
The proposed API allows a developer to do one lookup and update in place:

```js
upsert(key, old => updated, () => insertionValue)
```

### Normalization of values during insertion

Currently you would need to do 3 lookups:

```js
if (!map.has(key)) {
  map.set(key, value);
}
map.get(key).doThing();
```

With this proposal:

```js
map.upsert(key, o => o, () => value).doThing();
// or
map.upsert(key, undefined, () => value).doThing();
```

### Either update or insert for a specific key
You might get new data and want to calculate some aggregate if the key exists,
but just insert if it's the first value at that key.

```js
// two lookups
old = map.get(key);
if (!old) {
  map.set(key, value);
} else {
  map.set(key, old => updated);
}
```

With this proposal:

```js
map.upsert(key, () => updated, () => value)
```

### Just insert if missing

You might omit an update if you're handling data that doesn't change, but
can still be appended.

```js
// two lookups
if (!map1.has(key)) {
  map1.set(key, value);
}
```

With this proposal:

```js
map.upsert(key, o => o, () => value);
// or
map.upsert(key, undefined, () => value);
```

### Just update if present

You might want to omit an insert if you want to perform a function on
all existing values in a Map (ex. normalization).

```js
// three lookups
if (map.has(key)) {
  old = map.get(key);
  updated = old.doThing();
  map.set(key, updated);
}
```

With this proposal:

```js
map.upsert(key, old => old.doThing());
// or
map.upsert(key, old => old.doThing(), undefined);
```

## Implementations in other languages

Similar functionality exists in other languages.

**Java**

* [`computeIfPresent`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/Map.html#computeIfPresent-K-java.util.function.BiFunction-) remaps existing entry
* [`computeIfAbsent`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/Map.html#computeIfAbsent-K-java.util.function.Function-) insert if empty. computes
the insertion value with a mapping function

**C++**

* [`emplace`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/map/emplace) inserts if missing
* [`map[] assignment opts`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/map/operator_at) inserts if missing
at `key` but also returns a value if it exists at `key`
* [`insert_or_assign`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/map/insert_or_assign) inserts if missing. updates existing value by replacing with a 
specific new one, not by applying a function to the existing value

**Rust**

* [`and_modify`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/hash_map/enum.Entry.html#method.and_modify) Provides in-place mutable access to an occupied entry
* [`or_insert_with`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/hash_map/enum.Entry.html#method.or_insert_with) inserts if empty. insertion value comes from
a mapping function

**Python**

* [`setDefault`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict.setdefault)
Performs a `get` and an `insert`

## FAQ

- Is the goal to simplify the API or to optimize it?
  - This proposal seeks to simplify expressing intent for programmers, and
  should ease optimization without complex analysis. For engines without
  complex analysis like IOT VMs this should see wins by avoiding multiple
  entry lookups, at potential call stack cost.
- Why not use existing JS engines that optimize by coalescing the lookup and
mutation? 
  - This does not cover all patterns (of which there are many), things such as
  ordering can cause the optimization to fail.

  ```mjs
  if (!x.has(a)) x.set(a, []);
  if (!y.has(b)) y.set(b, []);
  x.get(a).push(1);
  y.get(b).push(2);
  ```
- Why use functions instead of values for the parameters?
  - You may want to apply a factory function when inserting to avoid costs of
  potentially heavy allocation, or the key may be determined at insertion time.
  - When updating, we will be able to perform a function on the existing value
  instead of just replacing the value. The action may also cause mutation or
  side-effects, which would want to be avoided if not updating.
- Why are we calling this `upsert`?
  - It is a combination of "update" & "insert" that is already used in other
  programming situations and many SQL variants use that exact term.
  - `updateOrInsert` and `insertOrUpdate` seem too wordy.
